# Auto Wave greadiometry method v3.0
This package aims to calculate the phase velocity and azimuth anisotropy of surface waves using the wave field spatial gradient (du/dx,du/dy) of seismic surface wave waves, and then to invert the three-dimensional velocity and anisotropic structure.  The package uses seismic waveforms recorded in 2007 by the ChinArray (2006) as an example. 

To use this package, you need to install MATLAB, CPS330 and OpenMPI, firstly.
