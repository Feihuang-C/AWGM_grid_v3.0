# Auto Wave greadiometry method v3.0
This package aims to calculate the phase velocity and azimuth anisotropy of surface waves using the wave field spatial gradient (du/dx,du/dy), and then to invert a 3D velocity model and anisotropic structure.  
To use this package, you need to install MATLAB, CPS330 and OpenMPI, firstly.
